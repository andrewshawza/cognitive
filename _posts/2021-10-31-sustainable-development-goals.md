I recently completed the unit entitled ‘Human Resources as a business partner’ in <a href="tbag.pxf.io/WDNkXe">ThePowerMBA</a>. This unit covers Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the shared blueprint adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The objective is to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all with clear targets by 2030.

Sustainability is so much more than being carbon neutral and focusing on climate change.

Are you aware of your company’s position on the 17 SDGs?

Which of the 17 SDGs are most important to you, and what actions are you taking?
